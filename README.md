## Getting Started

1. First, navigate to the project's directory, then install the dependencies usgin your preferred package manager, I personally used `npm`, using one of the following commands

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

2. After the dependecies are installed, run one of the following commands to run the server (`npm` recommended):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Time Frame

The frontend project took around 2 days, the configuration of the project took a significant portion of that, the rest was easy

## Note!

It is worth mentioning that each project could have been perfected more but I happened to be quite busy this week that's why I couldn't give it my all
